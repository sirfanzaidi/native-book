# Specification Quality Checklist: Book Chapters for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-21
**Feature**: [Book Chapters](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for learning outcomes and reader success
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (Module 1-4 + Capstone)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Specification is ready for planning phase.
- User stories properly prioritized (P1: foundations; P2: integration/extension).
- Each user story is independently testable and delivers incremental value.
- Edge cases identified for error handling and robustness.
- Assumptions documented explicitly for reader prerequisites and environment setup.
